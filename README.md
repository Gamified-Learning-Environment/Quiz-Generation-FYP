#FYP - Results Tracking Repository
This is the repository for handling the quiz generation within my Gamified Learning Environment. Quizzes will be crated using pre-built datasets and/or generative AI, adapting to a student’s particular needs based on user inputs such as topic and difficulty level. This will largely be the backend of the system.

### Contains: 
Logic for quiz generation from static data and the integration with AI (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) using prompt engineering.
### Technologies: 
Python (Flask/FastAPI), OpenAI API, MongoDB (for storing quiz data).

### Project Proposal Excerpt: 
Backend:
• Python with Flask/FastAPI: Chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in developing RESTful APIs and 
microservices. Research will have to be done to decide on which. 
• MongoDB: A NoSQL database will be used for storing user data, quiz history, and achievements. 
MongoDB's document-based structure makes it a sure fit for me to store my data flexibly.
• Generative AI (e.g., GPT-4, Claude): Used as one of the sources for quiz questions, hopefully using a 
student’s input with prompt engineering to ensure a personal learning space to their needs.
